With my expertise in chemical EMFs, biological research, physics, and nanomaterials, I have been able to make a career out of utilizing my passion for understanding the natural world. When I'm not hard at work, I love to get out and explore the great outdoors, going on long hikes to clear my head and get a good night's sleep after a hard day's work. I have a unique combination of professional and personal experience that have helped me excel in the field of chemical engineering, and I am looking forward to continuing to use my knowledge and skills to make meaningful contributions to the scientific community.","projects":[{"title":"ANEWTREEHACKSPROJECT","url":"https://github.com/saarnav890/ANEWTREEHACKSPROJECT","stars":0,"description":"Siteify Autogenerated Website ðŸš€","language":"TypeScript"},{"title":"AnotherOne","url":"https://github.com/saarnav890/AnotherOne","stars":0,"description":"Siteify Autogenerated Website ðŸš€","language":"TypeScript"},{"title":"asdf","url":"https://github.com/saarnav890/asdf","stars":0,"description":"Siteify Autogenerated Website ðŸš€","language":"TypeScript"},{"title":"asdfasdfasd","url":"https://github.com/saarnav890/asdfasdfasd","stars":0,"description":"Siteify Autogenerated Website ðŸš€","language":"TypeScript"}]}
